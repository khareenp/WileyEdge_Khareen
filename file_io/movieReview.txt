In the end, I'm disappointed. It started off fine, but it stayed fine for the 
rest of the film and in short I was expecting something more than just fine. 
I was waiting for some questions to be answered, some revelations, some explanations. 
I was most puzzled by the ending, which seemed too quick, almost cut off. Not to criticize,
 I liked the time setting. It added a bit of magic. At least for me. Summary. Bottom line. 
 It was okay, but I was expecting a little more. A little more depth to the story. 
 I missed some revelation or explanation. For me, an above average horror film that 
 I would only recommend to fans of the genre.
